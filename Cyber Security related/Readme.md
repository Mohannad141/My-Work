# Ciphering Program üîê  

##  Overview  
This program implements three **encryption & decryption algorithms** in C++:  
- **Affine Cipher**  
- **Baconian Cipher**  
- **XOR Cipher**  
---
##  Features  
- Encrypt & decrypt messages using multiple methods  
- Custom key support for XOR encryption  
- Supports uppercase & lowercase letters
